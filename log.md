# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on the data science in Python LiL course. Set up Anaconda/Jupyter on my Mac. Worked through the first section on creating, selecting, filtering, slicing  pandas data frames/series'

**Thoughts:** Concepts are easy to digest but i'll need to repeat the syntax in order for it to bed in. Works differently to selecting tables in SQL as you can work with multiple Axes.
