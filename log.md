# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made a start on the data science in Python LiL course. Set up Anaconda/Jupyter on my Mac. Worked through the first section on creating, selecting, filtering, slicing  pandas data frames/series'

**Thoughts:** Concepts are easy to digest but i'll need to repeat the syntax in order for it to bed in. Works differently to selecting tables in SQL as you can work with multiple Axes.

**Link to work:** Jupyter Notebook: http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Python%20Learning/Python%20For%20Data%20Science%20LiL/Exercise%20Files/Ch01/01_01/01_01.ipynb

### Day 2: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 2 more exercises on the data science in Python LiL course. Treating/cleansing missing value within pandas series' data frames & removing duplicates in pandas data frames.

**Thoughts:** All good! I need to memorise the syntax for throwing together data frames quickly. Square/curly parentheses placement etc.

### Day 3: June 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: 2 more exercises on the data science in Python LiL course. Concatenating values within pandas series' data frames & grouping data in pandas data frames. Also created my first machine learning model on the Iris dataset and trained it against 6 algorithms to predict flower species based on flower characteristics.

**Thoughts:** All good! I need to memorise the syntax for throwing together data frames quickly. I've done grouping/concatenating at work but it's good to go over it again and really try and hammer the syntax into LTM.
